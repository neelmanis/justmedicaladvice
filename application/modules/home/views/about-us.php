							<h1>How it all started</h1>
							<p>Having realized that a visit to a Doctor only takes place when one is faced with a healthcare challenge.</p>
							<p>Many conditions require education and support beyond the in-clinic setting. Also during our experience of conducting healthcare awareness programes for community members, we realized the need to educate the given population for conditions they are at high risk of; a case in point is our program for Diabetes screening and advice.</p>

							<h1>Where we are headed</h1>
							<p>We look forward to promoting health and healthcare awareness  across populations throughout the globe since without health; there can be very little meaning to life.  We are inspired to play our part in reducing the predicted numbers for different diseases and providing support to the one’s already diagnosed with them. Seems like a challenging task? Guess, we wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
