For example, if you begin a paid subscription on January 1st for a 14 day free trial, you will be charged on January 15th for the first month, February 15th for the second month, and so on. Your billing data may vary slightly if your billing date does not have a corresponding date the next month (i.e. enrollment started on January 31 will be billed on February 28). Failure to pay may result in the termination of your subscription. Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment method was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices, including because of exchange rates. JUST MEDICAL ADVICE does not support all payment methods, currencies or locations for payment.
